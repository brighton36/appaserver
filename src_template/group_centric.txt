Group Centric Paradigm
Tim Riley

Purpose
-------
The purpose of the group centric paradigm is to allow multiple
Linux users to write to common directories without having to
be root.

Vocabulary
----------
* User:	   Every login account has one user name.
* Group:   Every user name belongs to one or more groups.
	   Every group has a group name.
* World:   Every user belongs to the world.
	   The world does not have a name.
	   Instead, it is represented by the letter 'o'.
* Project: Colaborating users need group write access to project directories.
	   Add projects in /etc/group.
	   Add colaborating users to projects in /etc/group.

Set umask
---------
1) Set umask to 002 or 0002 in /etc/profile.
2) This instructs Linux to set the group write bit for new files
   and sub-directories.

File creation without group centric
-----------------------------------
* User:		receives full permissions
* Group:	receives restricted permissions
* World:	receives restricted permissions

File creation with group centric
--------------------------------
* User:		receives full permissions
* Group:	receives full permissions
* World:	receives restricted permissions

Access management
-----------------
1) Assign each new user to a project name that is the same as the user name.
2) Each user may be assigned to more projects in the /etc/group file.
3) For each working directory, set the group name: chgrp $project .
4) For each working directory, set the group SUID bit: chmod g+s .
5) For each working directory, set the write bit: chmod g+w .

The SUID bit for a directory instructs Linux to change the behavior
for new files and sub-directories. Instead of setting the group name
to the user's group, it sets the group name to the directory's group name.
