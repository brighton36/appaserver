<h2>Output Daily Moving Statistic</h2>
<p>This process computes a moving statistic of measurements for display. The process first aggregates all real-time measurements into daily values before it calculates the moving statistic.
<ul>
<li>Aggregate Statistic: A moving Minimum, Average, or Maximum may be calculated. If no Aggregate Statistic is selected, then Moving Average is calculated. 
<li>Begin and End Dates:
	<ul>
	<li>Leave both blank will report the entire period of record.
	<li>Enter a full Begin Date and End Date will report on that date range.
	<li>Enter only the year in Begin Date will report from January 1.
	<li>Enter only the year in End Date will report to December 31.
	<li>Enter only the year and month in Begin Date will report from the first day of that month.
	<li>Enter only the year and month in End Date will report to the last day of that month.
	<li>Enter a full Begin Date and leave the End Date blank will report on the single day.
	<li>Enter a only the year in Begin Date and leave the End Date blank will report on the entire year.
	<li>Enter a only the year and month in Begin Date and leave the End Date blank will report on the entire month.
	<li>Leave blank the Begin Date but populate the End Date will report from the beginning of record to the End Date.
	</ul>
<li>Exceedance Format yn:
	<ul>
	<li>If the "Exceedance Format yn" is set to "No", then the output is sorted by date.
	<li>If the "Exceedance Format yn" is set to "Yes", then the output is sorted by the moving average in descending order. Next to the moving average is a count of the number of days the moving average was below this moving average. Next to the count is the percentage with which the number of days the moving average was below this moving average.
	</ul>
<li>Days To Average: Optionally enter the number of days to average. If left blank, 30 days are used.
<li>Units Converted:
	<ul>
	<li>If a single datatype were selected on the Prelookup Screen, then that datatype's possible units to convert to is available for selection.
	<li>If more than one datatype were selected, then those datatypes' possible units to convert to are available for selection.  In this case, to convert the units, you need to know which unit the datatype selected is stored as.
	<li>If no datatype were selected, then all of the possible units to convert to is available for selection.  In this case, to convert the units, you need to know which unit the datatype selected is stored as.
	<li>Note: the units converted is displayed as units-the-datatype-is-stored-as, then a dash, then units-the-datatype-can-be-converted-to. The dash in the center is not part of the units, like "foot-seconds".
	</ul>
<li>Validation Level:
	<ul>
	<li>Provisional: none of the measurements selected will have been validated yet.
	<li>Validated: only validated measurements will be selected.
	<li>Either: all measurements will be selected.
	</ul>
<li>Output Medium:
	<ul>
	<li>Table: A table is displayed in the bottom window.
	<li>Chart: A Gracechart is displayed in a new window.
	<li>Transmit: A text file is created to transmit to your computer.
	</ul>
</ul>
