<h1>Harvest Report Help</h1>
<p>Creating the Harvest Report (Species Estimated Total Caught) requires
<ol>
<li>maintaining vessel counts collected periodically from
	aerial surveys.
<li> maintaining trailer counts collected daily.
</ol>
<p>Creating the Harvest Report also
requires updating two best-fit regression lines' coefficients and
y-intercepts. The values are stored in APPLICATION_CONSTANTS.
The two lines provide the estimated total vessels
in each of Florida Bay and Ten Thousand Islands.

<p>The two best-fit regression lines are calculated by running
the output process called "Calculate Trailer Vessel Regression."
Run this only after a new aerial survey takes place.

<p>The Harvet Report proper (Output Total Estimated Catch)
uses the two best-fit lines to estimate the number of
vessels each day based upon the number of trailers counted
each day.  The Harvest Report also estimates the number
of catches per fishing
vessel each day based upon the answers the the creel census taken
the previous weekend. These two values are multiplied for
every species for every day. 

<p>The complete algorithm is available
